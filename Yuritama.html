							<h1>Yuri Tama: From Third Wheel to Trifecta</h1>
									<p style="font-size:150%"><b>Author: Toshizou<br>Company: J-Novel Club<br>Status: 5/5 volumes translated<br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/yuri-tama-from-third-wheel-to-trifecta">Official Site</a></p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Yuritama 1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">The First<br></b></b>Yuna Momose and Rinka Aiba were made for each other, and their whole school knows it. Between Yuna's princess-like elegance and Rinka's prince-like charm, all their classmates see them as the ideal couple. Yotsuba Hazama is no exception to that, but she is exceptional in another way: she's somehow managed to become fast friends with both of them!<br><br>Having the whole school's favorite ship as her two best friends isn't exactly easy, though. Not only does it make everyone treat Yotsuba like a particularly obnoxious third wheel, it makes her feel like one too! Or at least it does, until one day, Yuna asks her out. And then Rinka asks her out too! And Yotsuba, whose social anxiety never seems to kick in until after she's already messed something up...says yes to both of them, without sparing so much as a single thought for the consequences. Oops!<br><br>Now Yotsuba only has one choice: keep her accidental two-timing under wraps and make both of her new girlfriends as happy as she possibly can!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/yuri-tama-from-third-wheel-to-trifecta#volume-1"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus stories)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B68J3R3S"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>

Summer vacation is just around the corner, and this year she gets to spend it with her two girlfriends, Yuna and Rinka! Sure, she’ll spend it doing makeup lessons instead unless she passes all her finals, but how hard could that be? And her girlfriends’ fan club is a ticking time bomb in the background of her school life, but it’s not like that has any chance of causing her problems! And, yes, her little sisters have been treating her with an inexplicable mixture of contempt and suspicion lately, but there’s no way that’ll go anywhere unpleasant!<br><br>On second thought, let’s start over: Yotsuba Hazama is in way over her head! Her first-ever summer with her new girlfriends is in peril of flunking-induced cancellation, her social standing at school is dangling by a thread, and she can’t even figure out what’s wrong with her relationship with her sisters, but it’s definitely going to be a problem! Who knew having two girlfriends could be this difficult?!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/yuri-tama-from-third-wheel-to-trifecta#volume-2"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus stories)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJVDHD9J"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Yuritama 3.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">The Third<br></b>Two crises deep into Yotsuba’s fledgling three-way relationship with Yuna and Rinka, her love life is finally reaching equilibrium. Her girlfriends approve of the unusual arrangement they’ve settled into, her little sisters begrudgingly acknowledge it, and it seems like life couldn’t get any better...which, of course, means it’s time for a new disaster to shake things up all over again!<br><br>For all the positive traits Yotsuba can’t bring herself to admit that she has, it’s undeniable that she also has a bad memory. Very bad. So bad that she just might’ve forgotten she had a childhood friend way back whenever, then failed to notice as said childhood friend became a nationally renowned pop idol, all to fulfill a promise she made with Yotsuba...which Yotsuba, of course, also forgot about. Their reunion could only possibly be more awkward if, say, Yotsuba’s old friend asked her for help faking a relationship...but what are the odds of that happening?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/yuri-tama-from-third-wheel-to-trifecta#volume-3"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus stories)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C33G8KRY"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Yuritama 4.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">The Fourth<br></b>Makina Oda has crash-landed into Eichou High with all the force of a shooting star, and Yotsuba’s already fragile social life has been caught in the blast! It would be bad enough if Makina were just a nationally renowned idol who also happened to be Yotsuba’s childhood friend, but the fact that she’s also dead set on winning Yotsuba’s affection has dialed the chaos—and awkwardness—up to eleven. Then, just when it seems like things can’t possibly get any worse, the annual cultural festival arrives and Makina, Yuna, and Rinka are thrown together in a project that could bring all those conflicts to a head at the same time!<br><br>Can Yotsuba navigate the interweaving needs of her friends and girlfriends, the pressures of an oncoming festival, and her own crippling social anxiety to save the day and make everyone happy? Not alone, that’s for sure! Where’s Koganezaki to help when Yotsuba needs her most?!<br><br>No, really... Where is Koganezaki?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/yuri-tama-from-third-wheel-to-trifecta#volume-4"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus stories)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F4JZHYBQ"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Yuritama 5.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">The Fifth<br></b>The good news: Yotsuba’s plan to unite her class in support of Yuna, Rinka, and Makina was a smashing success! The pervasive atmosphere of awkward discomfort that had been looming over her and her classmates is gone, and everyone’s finally ready to buckle down and make sure that their cultural festival idol show turns out as well as it possibly can! The bad news: A whole new problem for Yotsuba to stress over almost immediately rears its head! Mio Kuruma, Shooting Star’s second-in-command, bursts onto the scene in a desperate attempt to drag Makina back into show business! Worse still, she pulls Yotsuba into her scheme! How will Yotsuba contribute to the cultural festival, keep Mio from causing too much trouble, and resolve the ever so slight issue of Makina’s totally unaddressed feelings for her all at once?!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/yuri-tama-from-third-wheel-to-trifecta#volume-5"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br><br clear="all" /></p>
