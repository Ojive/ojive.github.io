Practically joined at the hip, they are convinced that their relationship will stay the same forever…until one day, Aoi wakes up to find Ryouta leaning in to kiss him! Now Aoi must unpack this bewildering development, but he just can’t seem to forget Ryouta’s touch…<br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Stand-Being-Childhood-Friend/dp/B0DW3T46DB"><b>Buy (Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>

However, new jobs mean less time together, and despite his best efforts, Ryota just can’t acclimate to the real estate firm he joined. On the other hand, Aoi won’t admit how lonely he feels for fear of sabotaging all his boyfriend’s hard work. Can these two find the right work-life balance that leads them back to each other?<br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Stand-Being-Childhood-Friend/dp/B0FQJ2J4PT"><b>Buy (Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
