I’ve been having dirty dreams lately—about getting groped by sea creatures! And even worse, these dreams include someone staring at me during my filthy fish time: the marine biology nerd from my class, Ogasawara-kun! The guy is so obsessed with undersea life that honestly, he kinda weirded me out at first. But now that I’m deep in the closet pretending to be “normal,” I think it’s attractive that he can be true to himself without caring what people think. Of course, the moment I realized I like him, my dreams became even more obscene! Cut to our hang-out at the aquarium, and while I’m looking at fish with Ogasawara-kun, I actually get turned on?! Seriously, what is wrong with me?!”<br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wet-Dream-Aquarium-non-food/dp/B0DBSQD1C7"><b>Buy (Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
