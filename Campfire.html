Stashed away among the piles of ill-begotten lucre is an item that catches Mukohda's attention: a magical tablet containing the autobiography of an ancient Sage, written in Japanese, of all things! What secrets could this mysterious book have to teach the other world's most cowardly chef? Who was the Sage, and how did he know Mukohda's native tongue? Will Mukohda manage to stay at home for more than a day before Fel and the others drag him off to another dungeon? And perhaps most importantly of all: What on earth is he supposed to do with the preposterous mountain of money that's been amassing in his Item Box all this time? Adventure awaits, whether Mukohda likes it or not!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/campfire-cooking-in-another-world-with-my-absurd-skill#volume-10"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus stories)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099XDJ96N"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>

Mukohda and his party of ever-ravenous familiars are finally ready to set foot in the Brixt dungeon, a notorious hellhole famed for being the hardest dungeon in the land! The God of All Creation himself warned our hero of the unspeakable horrors waiting below that even his overpowered allies couldn’t take lightly. Much to Mukohda's chagrin, this warning was no deterrent at all. The Brixt dungeon may be full of dangerous monsters, devious traps, and glory-hungry adventurers who’d sooner see an upstart like Mukohda six feet under than split a share of their loot with him, but it also promises piles of treasure, oodles of rare ingredients, and EXP in abundance! And speaking of EXP, it’s only a matter of time before Mukohda unlocks his third Supermarket Tenant that the gods have been pestering him about for so long...<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/campfire-cooking-in-another-world-with-my-absurd-skill#volume-11"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus stories)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TCNRZX6"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Campfire 12.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 12<br></b></b>Another day, another dungeon! Or rather, another day, the same dungeon, because even though Mukohda would much rather make the most of his mid-dungeon break by lingering on the surface and enjoying a breath or two of outside air, a certain trio of battle-happy gluttons have dragged him right back into the depths again! Fel, Sui, and Dora won’t be satisfied until they conquer every last floor that the Brixt dungeon has to offer, and the most Mukohda can do is grit his teeth and tag along for the ride. But hey, it’s not that bad—after all, if the first forty floors were simple enough for Team Familiar to steamroll through, then surely the next who-knows-how-many won’t pose any dangers or inconveniences either, right? And it’s not like there are any horrible primeval monsters lurking somewhere down there that everyone—except for Mukohda—has forgotten the gods specifically warned them about, right?!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/campfire-cooking-in-another-world-with-my-absurd-skill#volume-12"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus stories)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFZQQWD7"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Campfire 13.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 13<br></b>The long, dangerous dungeon crawl is over, and Mukohda and his familiars are finally homeward bound! After what felt like ages underground, Mukohda’s long overdue for some R&R back in Karelina, and this time he isn’t going to let anyone stand in between him and a golden chance to lounge about and not spend every hour of every day fearing for his life. Nothing could convince him to throw himself back into trouble. Nothing! Unfortunately for Mukohda, it’s only a matter of time before his decisions catch up with him and trouble comes calling whether he likes it or not. You can’t fly across several countries on an ancient dragon without turning a few heads, after all, and this time around, “trouble” has pointy ears, a terrible work ethic, and a pathological obsession with dragonkind even more intense than Mukohda’s desire to not get involved with any of this nonsense. What shenanigans will Mukohda’s self-proclaimed best friend in the whole wide world drag him into this time?

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Campfire 14.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 14<br></b></b>Enough is enough! The Church of Rubanov has violated Mukohda’s privacy one time too many—on top of their habit of trafficking their own people and subjugating the non-human races—and Demiurge, the God of All Creation, has finally decided that something must be done about them. What, specifically? Why, sending Mukohda and his familiars over to ruin their day in the most explosive manner possible, of course! Bringing down a dictatorial, human-supremacist theocracy isn’t the only item on Mukohda’s itinerary, though. He also has shopping to do, and conveniently enough, the one town where he stands any chance of replacing his irreparably damaged magic stove happens to be just a short hop away from the Holy Kingdom of Rubanov’s capital. However, that may not be the last stop on their trip if his familiars have anything to say about it...<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/campfire-cooking-in-another-world-with-my-absurd-skill#volume-14"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus stories)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9JX1G1S"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Campfire 15.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 15<br></b>Everything seems to be going so well for Mukohda in the wake of the Church of Rubanov incident. Not only has he managed to buy the magic stove of his dreams, he’s also stumbled into a surprise reunion with some old friends: the adventuring party Ark! The only thing that could possibly ruin the trip would be if, say, Fel revealed the location of a nearby, almost-untouched dungeon, and the members of Ark decided that they wanted to come along for the ride. But there’s no way that could happen, right?<br><br>Oh. Oh no.<br><br>And just like that, Mukohda’s off on another dungeon-crawling adventure that he’d really rather have no part in! Worse still, the thing about unexplored dungeons is that you never know what you'll find in them...and the discoveries awaiting the party in this one will blow any ideas they had about what a dungeon is supposed to be clear out of the water!

You can only spend so much time conquering dungeons, slaying legendary beasts, and causing international incidents before refusing to meet with the king stops making you look humble and starts making you look like you’re snubbing the crown. Mukohda, much to his dismay, has run squarely into that limit, and Willem the guildmaster has dragged him to the capital for a long-overdue royal audience!<br><br>But a trip to the capital isn’t all bad news. After all, the biggest city in the kingdom is also home to the biggest Adventurer’s guild around, and the guild headquarters is the one place where Mukohda stands any chance of fulfilling his familiars’ biggest objective: getting the leviathan they found in a dungeon butchered! The task is titanic, even by the capital’s standards, and it’s going to take everything and everyone the guild can spare—which means that Mukohda is due for a number of reunions, some much more welcome than others...<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/campfire-cooking-in-another-world-with-my-absurd-skill#volume-16"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDXN344S"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
