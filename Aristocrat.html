He isn’t a fighter, and he doesn’t know the first thing about his new world, but he does have one advantage that’s crucial for anyone who hopes to get by as a lord. Namely, an unprecedented eye for talent, granted to him by his special skill: Appraisal!<br>Thanks to that skill—and to his lack of consideration for his prospective retainers’ ages and origins—Ars has managed to gather up a formidable team of talented followers. Unfortunately, the empire he lives in is teetering on the brink of civil war. To make matters worse, the cornerstone of House Louvent and Ars’s father, Raven, has passed away at the worst possible moment! Ars has no choice but to take up his father’s mantle, make full use of his retainers’ talents, and protect and expand his territory as war rages around him, lest he lose everything he holds dear!<br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1647292085"><b>Buy (Print)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reincarnated-Aristocrat-Appraisal-Skill-World-ebook/dp/B0C7LX8WZH/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr="><b>Buy (Ebook)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>

Though mediocre at best in the fields of swordplay and strategy, Ars has one thing that gives him a major leg up on his fellow nobles: a skill called Appraisal, which he uses to see past the biases and preconceptions of his peers and gather up a host of capable followers!<br>All is not well in his new home of Lamberg, however. Missian, the duchy Ars’s barony lies within, has been plunged into a war of succession, and circumstances have prompted Ars to join forces with Couran, the elder of two brothers vying for the position of duke. Like it or not, Ars is about to find him and his followers playing a pivotal role in battles the likes of which he’s never imagined!<br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1647292174"><b>Buy (Print)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reincarnated-Aristocrat-Appraisal-Skill-World-ebook/dp/B0CKD88WW1/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr="><b>Buy (Ebook)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>

So great are his achievements over the course of the war that Ars soon finds himself receiving a promotion beyond his wildest imagination: he will become the new Count of Canarre! Now it's up to Ars to remedy all the political and economic woes that Canarre is plagued with...but before he's had time to even get started another conflict begins to brew, and this time much closer to home! A crisis is looming large, and only with the combined power of Appraisal and his talented retainers will Ars be able to stop it!<br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/164729312X"><b>Buy (Print)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reincarnated-Aristocrat-Appraisal-Skill-World-ebook/dp/B0CXVCMTH1/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr="><b>Buy (Ebook)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
