As the flames of revolution scour the land, the empire’s ever-selfish princess, Mia, is publicly executed by way of the guillotine...only to wake up in the past as her twelve-year-old self! The empire’s back, the revolution is a distant memory, and sweets are once again on the table! As the bloodstained diary she brought back with her proves, however, Mia’s memories of the future are by no means just a bad dream. All the horrors and indignities she experienced in that terrible timeline are bound to happen all over again... That is, unless she can shape herself up, recruit some allies, and exploit her knowledge of what’s to come to solve all of the empire’s problems before they spiral horribly (and lethally) out of control! Is Mia up to the lofty task of changing the future and saving her empire? Not even slightly, but it’s her only choice if she hopes to spare herself from a second gruesome end at the blade of the guillotine!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/tearmoon-empire-manga#volume-1"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718338511"><b>Buy (Print)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>

Doing all of that while also keeping up with your social life at a new school! That’s exactly the predicament that Mia has found herself in, but it gets worse: she’s also classmates with her greatest enemies from the timeline she was executed in! From the most perfect prince in history, Sion Sol Sunkland, to the de facto head of the academy’s social hierarchy, Rafina Orca Belluga, Mia is surrounded by the revolutionary army’s future leaders, and she couldn’t be more scared! A little abject terror, unfortunately, isn’t enough to excuse her from her social responsibilities as the Imperial Princess. She’ll have to find somebody to take her to the first dance of the year, and she’ll have to do it without provoking the ire of anyone important in the process. What could possibly go wrong?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/tearmoon-empire-manga#volume-2"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718338538"><b>Buy (Print)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Tearmoon 3.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 3<br></b></b>With the school dance finished (and with only a moderate number of injuries and kidnappings having occurred over the course of it), Mia’s stay at Saint-Noel Academy has finally begun in earnest! That’s right—it’s time for her to sit back, relax, and enjoy a luxurious and leisurely school life filled with... Wait, what do you mean, “lessons”? Indeed, not even the children of nobility can escape the myriad horrors of schoolwork. Fortunately for Mia, she’s been through all of this once before! Unfortunately for Mia, her memory is, shall we say, not her strongest asset. But hey—Mia’s survived worse, and compared to saving an empire from imminent doom, tricking her classmates into thinking she’s academically gifted should be a cakewalk! Besides, it’s not like she’ll have any conspirators to punish, connections to forge, or charming princes to woo in the meantime...right?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/tearmoon-empire-manga#volume-3"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718377541"><b>Buy (Print)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Tearmoon 4.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 4<br></b>Bare your blades, students of Saint-Noel! The biannual swordsmanship tournament has arrived, and the competition is as fierce as the stakes are high! Will Prince Abel manage to prevail in a battle of wills against his chauvinistic brother? Can anyone stop Prince Sion’s meteoric rise through the ranks? And when the day is finally won, who will emerge victorious as the academy’s finest swordsman? Unbeknownst to most of the student body, however, the most intense bout of the day will not be fought up on stage. No, that battle to end all battles will play out during the tournament’s lunch break, when Mia’s masterpiece of a sandwich is finally put to the test! Will her culinary genius manage to secure Abel’s affection—and, more importantly, the aid of his kingdom’s military in the event of a revolution? Or will Keithwood’s incessant nit-picking and idea-quashing ruin everything?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/tearmoon-empire-manga#volume-4"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718338570"><b>Buy (Print)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Tearmoon 5.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 5<br></b></b>Summer has arrived, and Mia’s on her way home for a peaceful vacation full of rest and relaxation...if only! Alas, there’s no such thing as a day off when you’re the princess of the continent’s mightiest empire—especially when said empire is still due to collapse on account of a famine any day now—and the moment she returns, Mia is beset by tasks and troubles from all sides! Being home isn’t without its benefits, though. For one thing, it means Ludwig’s around to guide Mia down the right path (and then give her all the credit for his achievements)! He’s not the only friend she’s made on her home turf either, though Mia herself has yet to realize that fact...nor the fact that a few unsavory characters in the empire’s peerage are cooking up a scheme that could spell doom for everyone, Mia included!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/tearmoon-empire-manga#volume-5"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMPWYVT1"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Tearmoon 6.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 6<br></b>Trouble is brewing on the outskirts of the Tearmoon Empire. A border dispute centered around an obscure stretch of woodland has been growing ever more contentious, and it’s only a matter of time before the imperial army and the tribe that lives in said forest end up in open warfare. How big of a problem could that really be? Big enough to spark the whole revolution, as it turns out! It’s up to Mia to find a way to resolve the issue before it devolves into a massacre, but she won’t be able to do it alone...and the only one capable of helping her just so happens to be Dion Alaia, the man who lopped off her head in the previous timeline! How’s a princess supposed to save the day when her closest ally is also her greatest foe?!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/tearmoon-empire-manga#volume-6"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR9ZZQFB"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Tearmoon 7temp.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 7<br></b></b>The incident in the Sealance Forest has come to a close, and thanks to Mia’s slightly bumbling but incredibly fortunate efforts, nobody even died! Now it’s time for her to sit back, relax, and enjoy the summer holidays...or at least, it would be, if it weren’t for the fact that she still has plenty of fallout to contain and potential allies to ingratiate herself to. There’s never a second to waste when revolution looms on the horizon! Mia’s efforts to save her skin, however, are about to be thrown for a loop when something truly unexpected happens to the diary that’s been her one source of guidance since her mysterious jaunt back in time began. And as if that wasn’t shocking enough, the political situation of the empire and its surrounding nations is about to be turned on its head in the least expected way possible!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/tearmoon-empire-manga#volume-7"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
