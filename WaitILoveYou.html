In spite of their busy schedules, they do their best to make time for each other. When Aoi shares that he’s been cast as the star in an upcoming movie being filmed in Hokkaido, Haruto is thrilled for his lover, yet sad at the prospect of spending three months apart. Only minutes after hearing the news, though, Haruto receives his own offer to fill-in as a hair and make-up artist for the same movie Aoi is starring in! Will they be able to keep their relationship a secret? Or will working in such close proximity expose their love to the world?<br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wait-Love-You-Vol-Omayu/dp/B0F9V6XR68"><b>Buy (Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
