							<h1>When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace</h1>
									<p style="font-size:150%"><b>Author: Kota Nozomi<br>Company: J-Novel Club<br>Status: 13/13 volumes translated<br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace">Official Site</a></p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Inou 1.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 1<br></b></b>Andou Jurai is a second-year highschooler with the mind of an eighth-grade edgelord. His self-indulgent fantasies and over the top antics make him a constant pain in the neck for his friends in the literary club...until, that is, they all suddenly awaken to spectacular supernatural powers! Their godlike abilities include stopping time, manipulating the elements, creating matter from nothing, subverting the very laws of reality, and...producing black fire that doesn’t burn. (Some superpowers are more godlike than others.) Andou's read enough comics to know what comes next: it’s only a matter of time before they'll be dragged into life-or-death battles with the fate of the world itself at stake! The world, however, disagrees. There are no villains, no battles, no earth-shattering disasters—nothing whatsoever. Half a year later, the literary club finds themselves confronting a new question: what do you do with supernatural powers when your day to day life is as commonplace as ever?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-1"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MKX2HQ8"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Inou 2.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 2<br></b>Half a year after their powers awakened, the literary club has finally won its first ever supernatural battle! Well...kind of, anyway. It may have been more of a comedy of errors than an actual battle, but Andou isn’t about to let that stop him from basking in his (accidental) victory! What very well may stop him, however, are the advances of the very foe he’d just defeated. Kudou Mirei, the president of the student council, may have lost the battle, but she’s by no means out of the picture! Just days after their first encounter, she pays a second visit to the literary club with an even crazier objective than she had the first time! Misunderstandings and superpowered slice-of-life shenanigans abound in the literary club’s second not-so-epic adventure!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-2"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09S6LNKGB"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Inou 3.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 3<br></b>It’s a beautiful morning! The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and Chifuyu’s dropping out of elementary school. Wait. What?! Spoiler alert: the truancy crisis turns out to be a huge misunderstanding, and everything goes back to normal instantly. Nope, no deeper meanings or looming repercussions to worry about here! And that means it’s time for the literary club to return to their old standby: screwing around with their powers for kicks! From tennis to cosplay, our heroes have a full lineup of commonplace activities to take to truly extraordinary extremes, and that’s not even starting on the chance encounters with friends new and old! ​Good thing there’s no drama looming in the background that could get in the way of all that supernatural fun, right? ...Right?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-3"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YD2H42S"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Inou 4.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 4<br></b>Takanashi Sayumi has always held herself to high standards. If she takes a test, she aims to ace it. If given a responsibility, she does her best to fulfill it. Whether at work or at play, she seeks to act in a manner that is worthy of praise. This makes it all the more surprising that she wound up the president of the literary club, an underachieving organization home to the biggest weirdos in the entire school—or at least one of them. What caused Sayumi to become so earnest and diligent? How did she end up becoming the literary club’s president? And most perplexingly of all, why did she ever allow Andou to join the club in the first place? The answers lie within the literary club’s past, before its members obtained their godlike supernatural powers...<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-4"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B711HWSY"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Inou 5.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 5<br></b>Who is Kiryuu Heldkaiser Luci-First? When he says he’s a fallen angel, is he communicating something profound, or is he just being an edgelord? Why does he have to be so fanatically dedicated to the cause of cringe? And most importantly of all...what’s the deal with all these supernatural powers, anyway?! Kiryuu, unfortunately, isn’t the type to answer questions (at least, not the ones people actually ask him). Thankfully, a certain someone is much more forthcoming: Saitou Hitomi, Kiryuu’s oldest friend and the woman who’s been by his side for nearly the entirety of his quixotic quest. Through her eye, we can witness his exploits firsthand...and, just maybe, begin to understand their purpose. The time has come to take a peek behind the curtain and see what’s been happening in the background while Andou and the literary club wallow in their perfectly commonplace lives. Who knows—maybe we’ll even get to watch a supernatural battle or two in the process!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-5"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG7R2GVJ"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Inou 6.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 6<br></b>Andou Jurai and Sagami Shizumu have a complicated relationship, to say the least. Although Andou claims the two of them are “more than acquaintances but less than friends,” it’s plain to see that there’s more to it than that—and just as obvious that Andou would really rather not talk about it. Some things feel better left forgotten, and for Andou, many such things happened when he was in the eighth grade. After all, that was when he met Sagami and they really were friends, and worse yet, it was when he’d stopped being a chronically edgy chuuni cringelord. What painful feelings lurk within Andou’s memories of the darkest period of his life? How did his friendship with Sagami deteriorate into the lukewarm tolerance they have now? And why did Andou emerge from the crucible as Guiltia Sin Jurai? For Sayumi’s sake, he’s finally willing to bare it all...<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-6"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C71HWP77"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Inou 7.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 7<br></b>Summer is here! Swimsuits and poolside shenanigans await Andou when Chifuyu asks him to do team trivia at the water park. But the fun doesn’t stop there! Andou’s in for some slipping and sliding summertime memories when Sayumi invites him to spend time with her at the pool. That’s not all, though: Andou’s determined to live out his vacation to the fullest with some fun in the sun when Hatoko wants to hang out together at the beach. Even after all that, Andou’s not content to rest on his laurels, since he’s happy to dive into a day of splashing around and munching on junk food with Tomoyo when she offers him her spare water park ticket. Wait...huh? Why does everyone keep asking to spend one-on-one time with him around large bodies of water? Not just to fill an arbitrary beach episode quota, that’s for sure! Plots will be hatched, schemes will be schemed, and secrets will be revealed as the girls of the literary club make the most of their time alone with Andou!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-8"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9Q2FDJK"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Inou 8.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 8<br></b>Summer vacation is over, school is back in session, and the literary club has returned to their old pastime: making a loud, chaotic nuisance of themselves! It’s no surprise when the president of the student council, Kudou Mirei, stops by to pay them a visit...except she’s not there to scold them for their super-powered antics. No, she’s there to consult with them on a more serious matter: the upcoming cultural festival! An unusually large room is up for grabs, and it has fallen to the literary club to find a way to use it. So, what do you do when you have five members, limited talent, and a dedicated block in the festival’s schedule to fill? Put on a play, of course! And what better production than the most literary play around: Romeo and Juliet! Only one question remains: who will star as the show’s tragic heroine? ...Wait, no, don’t look at the cover!

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Inou 9.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 9<br></b>The Wings of Fallen Black are a cadre of Players as powerful as they are mysterious! Disparate though their causes and motives may be, they’ve come together under the leadership of the man known—nay, feared—as Ancient Lucifer: Kiryuu Heldkaiser Luci-First! Although Kiryuu may be an insufferable, untrustworthy, overly dramatic chuuni cringelord, his allies have nevertheless been drawn to his side due to...uhh, reasons? Probably? Let’s be real: when all’s said and done, it’s unclear why most of Kiryuu’s Players-in-arms decided to join his squad. In particular, why would Toki Shuugo and Akutagawa Yanagi, two young men who only agree when it comes to their distaste for authority and each other, debase themselves by working for a guy like him? It seems inevitable that they’d jump ship at the first chance to betray him...so when the opportunity comes knocking, the choices they make and the consequences they face may come as a surprise to everyone—especially Shuugo and Yanagi themselves!<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-9"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLS85RFT"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Inou 10.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 10<br></b>Nothing lasts forever—especially not in high school. Seasons change, events come and go, and torches are passed as time marches ever onward. For all their godlike powers, not even the literary club is exempt from the transience of the academic year...and so the time has come for their beloved president, third-year student Takanashi Sayumi, to step down from her position and name a successor to carry on her legacy...but not before she and her clubmates squeeze in another swimsuit episode first! There’s always room in the schedule for zany shenanigans, and this time around, the gang will be joined by the newly retired ex-president of the student council, Kudou Mirei, in a cameo appearance!

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Inou 11.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 11<br></b>It’s finally happened. A full year after Andou and his literary club friends awakened to tremendously potent powers, the world of supernatural battles has finally arrived at their doorstep in the form of Tamaki: a girl from the darkest moment in Andou’s past! Andou has plenty of baggage with Tamaki, and Tamaki seems to have quite an axe to grind with him, so when she spirits him away to an unfamiliar cityscape, it seems safe to say her intentions are less than peaceful. Worse still, the nature of Tamaki’s power means that there’s little to no hope of Andou’s significantly more combat-capable friends storming onto the scene to bail him out! If Andou wants to make it out unscathed, he’ll have to confront his past head-on and use both his wits and his power to their fullest potential!<br><br>But, of course, Andou’s plight pales in comparison to one single, burning question: what’s Sagami up to while all of that’s going down?<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-11"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1CC1FCG"><b>Buy (Ebook, Amazon)</b></a><br clear="all" /></p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Inou 12.jpg" alt="" /></span><br><b style="font-size:150%">Volume 12<br></b>At last, a long-fated reunion: Guiltia Sin Jurai and Kiryuu Heldkaiser Luci-First are face-to-face once more, and their meeting spells— Wait, what? This isn’t the final novel? There’s a whole volume full of side-stories to get through before the story ends? Well, never mind, then! Take two!<br><br>Every name has a story behind it. Sometimes, those stories are simple and straightforward; other times, they’re elaborate, downright convoluted deep dives into the minds of whoever comes up with them. Needless to say, the names that Andou Jurai has bestowed upon his superpowered clubmates’ abilities are of the latter variety—and now, it’s finally time for their true origins to be unveiled! Join Andou in an extremely silly (and dubiously canon) peek into the literary club’s past, wherein he struggles against his clubmates’ indifference by endeavoring to invent the perfect name for each and every one of their god-tier abilities!

Or at least...that was the plan. Stories, however, rarely develop in exactly the directions their authors intend them to, and Sagami isn’t the only character in Kiryuu’s tale who’s decided to jump the rails and take their role in a whole new direction. As plot threads, character arcs, and last second twists collide, it’s anyone’s guess who might have what it takes to thwart Kiryuu’s nefarious master plan for Andou and the literary club—or, for that matter, to figure out what his master plan even is. <br><br>The time has come. The die is cast. The beginning of the end of the beginning...has begun.<br><br><a href="https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-13"><b>Buy (Ebook, JNC—includes bonus translator's notes)</b></a><br><br clear="all" /></p>
